- [X] Switch to a Flakes setup
- [X] Use Mae's gren-treesitter (officially added to the nvim-treesitter plugin)

Maybe:

- [ ] Switch to Lix? https://lix.systems/add-to-config/#flake-based-configurations
- [ ] Try https://flake.parts/
- [ ] Consider/try snowfall lib
- [ ] Better documentation
- [ ] anything I can do about how slow it is?
